# Introduction

This is the frontend of the `walkman` project. It's nascent form is that of Juko pt 2, a recreation-from-scratch of a project I developed a few years ago (Spring 2019).

It's a react based frontend which makes API requests to both the Spotify backend directly (to generate an authentication code and create a Web player) and a Django backend specifically for `walkman` (for the rest of the Spotify interactions). 

# Components

`Login` - login page taken from (here)[https://dev.to/dipscoder/spotify-authentication-using-client-react-and-server-expressjs-27l0]

`App` - loads the Spotify player and starts playing recommended tracks generated by the Django backend
